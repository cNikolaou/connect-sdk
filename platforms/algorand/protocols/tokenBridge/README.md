# ALGORAND TOKEBRIDGE PROTOCOL

Part of the functionality of the Algorand TokenBridge is moved from the
implementation of:
- Wormhole's SDK for [Algorand](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/38f02fa2fc8e80fc3af213959fe397cc6a936778/sdk/js/src/algorand)
- Wormhole's SKD for the [TokenBridge](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/tree/38f02fa2fc8e80fc3af213959fe397cc6a936778/sdk/js/src/token_bridge)

Functions have been copied and altered to fit the implementation of the current SDK.
